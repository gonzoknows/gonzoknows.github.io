I wanted to create a personal website that is simple, responsive, and effective in educating others.

## Site Navigation

My site offers multiple ways to navigate and find information. The most efficient method is to use the search bar located in the top right corner. Additionally, the top left of the site allows for searching by category, tags, and date posted.

## Site Features 

My website offers a range of features, including:

- Automatic switching between dark and light mode, compatible with Apple devices
- Advanced in-text search engine for precise results
- Localized comments, with free hosting provided by Github
- Atom Feeds, which are RSS feeds for apps
- Social media integration, including the ability to share on Twitter, Facebook, Telegram, and by providing a link.
